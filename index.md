## Features

- **Efficient Data Management**: The MCP service handles metadata efficiently, ensuring quick access to your data.
- **Integration with DuckDB**: Utilize DuckDB for fast OLAP queries on your timeseries data.
- **Parquet Support**: Store your data in the Parquet format for optimized storage and retrieval.
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: Navigate large datasets easily with our cursor implementation.
- **Lakehouse Architecture**: Leverage the benefits of both data lakes and data warehouses.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/QuoccHuyy12/gigapi-mcp/releases). Follow the instructions provided in the release notes to install and execute the service.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Python 3.8 or later (for local development)
- Access to a compatible database (DuckDB recommended)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuoccHuyy12/gigapi-mcp.git
   cd gigapi-mcp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Configuration**:
   Modify the `config.yaml` file to set up your database connection and other settings.

4. **Run the Service**:
   Execute the following command to start the MCP service:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the service is running, you can interact with it via API endpoints. The service supports several operations:

### Metadata Management

- **Add Metadata**: POST request to `/metadata/add`
- **Retrieve Metadata**: GET request to `/metadata/get`
- **Update Metadata**: PUT request to `/metadata/update`
- **Delete Metadata**: DELETE request to `/metadata/delete`

### Data Queries

Use the following endpoints to query your timeseries data:

- **Fetch Timeseries Data**: GET request to `/timeseries/get`
- **Aggregate Data**: POST request to `/timeseries/aggregate`

### Cursor Implementation

To handle large datasets, use the cursor-based pagination. Include the `cursor` parameter in your GET requests to navigate through the data.
